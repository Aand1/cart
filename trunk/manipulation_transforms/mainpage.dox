Provides a mechanism for computing grasp poses from pose of a grasped object and vice-versa.  Assumes grasp is rigid, I.E. during the extent of grasp the relative transforms between the grippers and the object aren't allowed to change.  These transforms are all specified relative to the base_footprint frame during initialization.

\section codeapi Code API

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
